This is a servlet class. Servlets contain a number of methods to handle different types of requests sent
to a specific endpoint (representing a specific resource). In this case, any requests sent to the "/demo" endpoint.
That means that the URL to access this resource would look something like this:

        Query and path params are different.
        This is a URL with query params at the end:
            www.host.com/contextpath/path/to/resource/file.txt?key1=value1&key2=value2
        At the end, the '?' character signifies the beginning of the query parameters. These are
        key value pairs where keys are separated from values with '=', and pairs are separated with '&'

        This is a URL with path parameters:
            www.host.com/contextpath/path/to/resources/3/accounts/123
        In this URL there are two path params, '3' and '123'. These are variables listed right in the URI tokens.
        There's no indicator, we would have to know and document where in the URI those should appear.

         */

        //Java servlets API doesn't have great support for using path params, because of the limited way in which
        //we can use the wildcard (*) in the servlet mapping. We can use the wildcard at the end of the mapping:
        //      /something/something/*

       /*
       But we can't have the wildcard appear in the middle of a URI. This means we can't have the webserver
       map URIs with variables in the middle to the proper servlets. But, where there's a will there's a way.
       We could send all URIs to a single servlet and from there parse the URI and direct it to another servlet.
       This is called the "Front Controller Design Pattern". We can tokenize the URI like below, and then
       perform all sorts of operations based on what was sent.

        Also if they were supported, we could mix and match query and path params:
            www.host.com/contextpath/path/to/resources/3/accounts?accountNum=900182&owner=123123
        We will see these used in Javalin and Spring Data
