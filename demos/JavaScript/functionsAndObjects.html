    /*
    There are several ways to define a function in JS. We have regular funcitons, anonymous funcitons,
    arrow functions (anonymous ad-hoc functions), and even IIFE - imediately invoked function expression
    */


    //a normal funciton expression, this funciton can be invoked by name "myFunction()"
    function myFunction() {
        console.log("This is myFunction()");
    }

    myFunction();

    This is an anonymous funciton. It doesn't have a name. We assign it into a variable
    called fun, but that isn't the function's name. We invoke this by applying a parameter
    list to the variable name fun();

    /*
    Here we have another anonymous funciton, but this one is written with arrow syntax.
    This is the same as lambda function expression in Java, except the arrow is written 
    as => instead of ->.

    This is an anonymous ad-hoc function. ad-hoc basically means "on demand" or "when needed".
    This is commonly how we would write a callback function. Think of Javalin in Java, when we 
    define the callback functions for our endpoints.
    app.get("/endpoint", () -> {System.out.println("something")})

    In the below example we are again assigning the anonymous funciton to a variable so we can call it.
    But, that is not the function's name. It doesn't have one.

        console.log("This is fun2()");

    fun2();

    /*
    This is IIFE - imediately invoked funciton expression. This is a way of writing a function
    which is imediately resolved and invoked. The funciton definition is inside (parenthesis)
    which tells the interpreter that this definition should resolve first. When it resovles, it
    is a function which can be called. Right after this, the very next syntax is a parameter list,
    which is exactly the syntax which invokes a function.

    Below we create an object, note that we don't have to define a class. This is how we write
    basic objects in JS. This is where JSON comes from. JSON is "JavaScript Object Notation", we use
    (almost) the same syntax to define objects in JS as we do to define JSON objects.

    Objects are a variable type, and can be assigned into any variable just like any other
    data type in JS. Below we define an object and assign it into the variable "obj".

    /*
    These objects have properties. Above, key1, key2, string, num, pi, and sumFunc are all properties
    of the object. The first 5 are all variables just like we see declared with var, let and const. 
    However, var let and const are not valid in an object. You simply declare the name of the 
    property and assign it some value. Likewise, we do not use the '=' operator for assignment. 
    We write the property name and a ':' colon, then the value.

    Functions are just variables like anything else. In the above object we assigned a function
    to the property 'sumFunc'. We can de-reference our object with the '.' dot operator
    and call sumFunc() just like we would in Java.
