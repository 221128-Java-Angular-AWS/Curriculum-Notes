    Below we have the variable keywords var, let, and const.
    Var was in the earliest versions of javascript. Let and const were introduced later
    in ES6 when the scoping rules changed.

    Var gets hoisted, that is it can be used before it is declared. This is a very dumb thing JS did,
    and they dropped this behavior when let and const were introduced. Var still hoists, let and const
    do not. Var is still scoped in the same way. Let and const use the new scoping rules.

    //We'll discuss those at another time.

    JS has all the same flow control statements as c, c++, and Java. for loop, while loop, 
    do-while loop, if-then-else, switch... JS also has an equivelant of the enhanced for loop.
    JS actually has 2 enhanced for loops, for-in and for-of. 

    For-in iterates through the keys (property names) of an object, and we can de-reference an object
    sort of like an array, by putting the key name inside [square brackets]. See below example.

    /*
    Type coercion - JS has a concept called coercion, where for the purposes of certain statements
    values are temporarily "coerced" or converted into another type. For instance, if we wanted to check
    to see if the numeric value 5 is equivalent  to the string "5". Of course these two things are not
    equal, one is a string and one is a number. But, they might be equivalent. These are different
    representations of the same value. So if we convert "5" -> 5 or 5 -> "5" we can compare the two:
    "5" == "5" is true
    5 == 5 is true.
    "5" == 5 is true.
    5 == "5" is true.
    This is type coercion. 

    Type coercion leads is to another JS concept, truthy and falsy. The predicate results of true and false
    are boolean data type. if statements as well as loops and many other things will need to check
    if some predicate is true. But even when dealing with something that is neither true nor false,
    like the number 5, we can coerce a true or false value out of these. The rules for this conversion
    are "truthy" and "falsy". There are 6 things which are considered "falsy" which means they will
    be coerced into the boolean type with a value of false. Everything else is "truthy".

    The 6 falsy values are:
    boolean false - false
    empty string - ""
    undefined variable - let x;
    null variables - x = null;
    NaN - (10/0) - (10/0) = NaN
    numerical zero - 0

    These 6 thigs when checked for a predicate value, like in an if statement, will resolve to 
    false. All other values will resolve to true.

    if (5) {
        console.log("5 is truthy!")
    }

    if (0) {
        console.log("0 is not truthy!");
    } else {
        console.log("0 is falsy.");
    }


    if ((10 / 0)) {//10/0 = infinity. 
        console.log("infinity is truthy!")
    }

    if ((10 / 0) - (10 / 0)) {//10/0 = infinity; infinity - infinity = NaN
        console.log("NaN is not truthy...");
    } else {
        console.log("NaN is falsy!");
    }

    let un;
    let nu = null;
    if ("" || un || nu) {// empty string, undefined, null - all are falsy. || is logical OR
        console.log("These are not truthy");
    } else {
        console.log("The empty string, undefined variables, and null references are all falsy.");
