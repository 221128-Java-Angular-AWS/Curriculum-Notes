## Summary

**Containers**

- A container runs on the container engine, which is simply an application running in the operating system
- Containers can utilize OS resources, and/or contain their own guest OS
- Containers are a lightweight solution compared to VMs

**Virtual Machine**

- A virtual machine is an environment that has its own isolated virtual hardware and guest operating system
- A VM requires more configuration and infrastructure, and is considered to be 'heavier' than a container
