## Real-World Application

A very common issue in development is where the software being developed works on one machine, but not another due to how these environments differ. Often times the application will not function at all, other times it may experience poor performance. This can be due to different operating systems, libraries, dependencies, or even just version mismatches. 

Docker is a containerization tool which will bundle the software along with its dependencies. Docker will even run a guest OS like a VM. This portable container can be deployed on any environment with a working Docker engine quickly and easily. 

Docker also offers modern cloud features. DockerHub is a repository where you can publish and retrieve docker images. You can push your container up to the cloud and pull it down wherever needed with a few keystrokes.
