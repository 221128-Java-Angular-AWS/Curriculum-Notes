**Container**

- A container is a software unit that contains one or more applications and dependencies as a package.
- By using this container, the application can be quickly deployed to a different environment.
- A computer can run many containers at once.
  
**Virtual Machine**

- A virtual machine emulates hardware and runs its own guest OS.
- A computer can run many virtual machines at once.
- Each virtual machine has its own isolated virtual hardware.

**Key Differences**
- Virtual machines emulate hardware, while containers do not.
- Containers are considered lightweight compared to VMs.
- Containers are designed to keep software portable, while VMs are used more for flexability and scalability.
