A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies, so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application.

# Advantages of using  
- Ease of use - Docker has made it much easier for developers, systems admins, architects and others to take advantage of containers to quickly build and test portable applications. 

- Speed  - Docker containers are very lightweight and fast. Since containers are just sandboxed environments running on the kernel, they take up fewer resources. 

- Docker Hub - Docker users also benefit from the increasingly rich ecosystem of Docker Hub, which you can think of as an “app store for Docker images.” 

- Modularity and Scalability - Docker makes it easy to break out your application’s functionality into individual containers. For example, you might have your Postgres database running in one container and your Redis server in another while your Node.js app is in another. With Docker, it’s become easier to link these containers together to create your application, making it easy to scale or update components independently in the future.
